# getInfo
Gather information for any kind of file inside linux. Information like owner, permissions and tipe of file. Script is under development.

Right now when retrieving information we need the entire path in case desired files are not in the folder from where the script is executed.

New feature in the future: finding files/directorries in case entire path was not given. Tested it but it takes too long. Currently under development.
